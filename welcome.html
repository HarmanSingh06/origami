<p><text style = "font-size:40px;">Origami</text>, from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due 
    to rendaku)) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" 
    is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat 
    square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally 
    discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to 
    designs which use cuts.</p>
